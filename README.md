# *Credit Scoring Model Using Gradient Boosting Classifier*

## Overview:

This project focuses on building a Credit Scoring Model using the Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithm. Credit scoring models are crucial in finance for determining the creditworthiness of individuals by predicting whether a person is likely to repay a loan. The model uses a variety of features from a dataset to assess the likelihood of loan repayment, providing insights that help lenders make better decisions.

## Features
***Credit Scoring Prediction*** : 
Predicts whether a customer is creditworthy based on a set of input features.

***Gradient Boosting Classifier*** : 
The model uses the Gradient Boosting Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to improve accuracy.

***Data Preprocessing***:
Handles missing data, scales numerical features, and applies the Yeo-Johnson transformation for better normalization.

***Model Evaluation***:
Provides detailed model performance metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1 score.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features about individuals, such as:

**Income**: Annual income of the individual.

**Age**: Age of the individual.

**Number of Dependents**: Number of dependents an individual supports.

**Loan Amount**: The amount of loan requested by the individual.

**Credit History**: Whether the individual has defaulted before or not.

These features are used to predict the credit score of the individual.

## Results
After training the model, it achieved the following performance on the test dataset:

***Accuracy***: 80%

***ROC-AUC Score***: 0.78

***F1-Score***: 0.78

These results demonstrate the modelâ€™s effectiveness in predicting creditworthiness with a high degree of accuracy.
